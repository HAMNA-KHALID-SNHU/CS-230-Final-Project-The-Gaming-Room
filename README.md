# CS-230-Final-Project-Software-Design-Document

## Project Overview
This repository contains my final deliverables for **CS-230: Operating Platforms** at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).  

The project focuses on developing a **Software Design Document (SDD)** for *The Gaming Room* client. The design demonstrates my ability to analyze client requirements, evaluate platform options, and recommend a scalable solution for deploying the game *Draw It or Lose It* as a web-based, multi-platform application.  

The deliverables highlight my skills in **system analysis, UML modeling, platform evaluation, and secure software design**.

## Reflection Questions

### Who was the client, and what software did they want?  
The client, **The Gaming Room**, requested expansion of their Android-only game *Draw It or Lose It* into a **web-based, cross-platform application**. The solution needed to support multiple users, enforce single-instance game management, and ensure secure authentication.  

### What did I do particularly well?  
I excelled in aligning the **UML domain model with code implementation**, ensuring consistency across the SDD. I also provided a clear **platform evaluation** that compared Linux, Windows, Mac, and mobile devices, leading to a strong, research-backed recommendation.  

### What helped me when developing code?  
Creating the SDD forced me to think critically about **scalability, memory management, and security** before coding. This preparation reduced ambiguity and made the coding process more straightforward.  

### What would I revise?  
If I revised the work, I would expand the **Recommendations section** with a detailed cost-benefit analysis of AWS vs. Azure for cloud deployment, giving the client stronger financial insights.  

### How did I interpret and implement user needs?  
I considered **usability, cross-platform accessibility, and secure session management** as top priorities. User needs drive software design because no matter how technically strong a system is, it fails if users can’t interact with it effectively and securely.  

### How did I approach designing software, and what strategies would I use again?  
My approach combined **object-oriented modeling (UML), design patterns (Singleton/Iterator), and platform analysis**. In the future, I would continue using UML early in projects, adopt **containerization** for scalability, and integrate **security-by-design** practices from the start.

## Portfolio Note
This artifact demonstrates my ability to **bridge technical design and client communication**. It showcases my strengths in documenting requirements, evaluating platforms, and recommending scalable solutions. Including this in my portfolio highlights not only my technical knowledge of operating platforms but also my ability to create **clear, client-ready documentation** that supports development teams.
